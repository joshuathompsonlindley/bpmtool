# BPMTool

A tool for calculating BPM and Pitch based on different changes to a sample. Built in WinForms and .NET Core 3.1

This tool was originally made for personal use, but I added a WindowsForms GUI and decided to release it.

## Usage:

Launch the application and fill in the appropriate fields and click calculate. Some figures could not be 100% accurate, or there might be a discrepancy in some calculations, this is due to the application rounding to 2 decimal places, as this is the standard for tempo and pitch in Ableton Live (as of 10.1.25). Your DAW/Audio tool may accept more or less precision in these values.
